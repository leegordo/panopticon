# About
Meet The Panopticon, a Processing + Arduino powered prototype/sculpture that can recognize human faces and swivel to follow them. It's a reminder that the technologies we love and the governments meant to protect us are spying on us with impunity. 

It’s based on http://gregborenstein.com/ libraries, hacked together with a tutorial from http://www.duino-robotics.com/face-tracking.html

I’d like to get as many of us making these as we can, placing them around the cities of the world, reminding everyone of the world we live in.

Please reach out if you’re interested in helping improve, or adding to the project.

# Usage
If you're familiar with Arduino and Processing, this should be a snap for you. If you're like me, and you like to hack together what others have done, I can probably help. Just ask.

#Specs
I'm using a RedBoard from Sparkfun, with a simple servo that came with the inventor's kit. I'm running Processing/OpenCV from my Macbook Air with a cheap webcam attached to said servo.
